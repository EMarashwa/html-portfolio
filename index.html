    <h3><a href="./public/movielistindex.html">My Best Movie List</a></h3>
    <p>As part of my HTML learning journey, I created a simple movie ranking list. This project allowed me to practice structuring content using HTML tags and creating lists to display information.</p>

    <h3><a href="./public/indexbday.html">Birthday Invite Project</a></h3>
    <p>Another project I completed is a basic birthday invitation page. It was a fun exercise in applying HTML to create a static webpage with information about an event, including date, time, and location details.</p>

    <h3>Future Goals</h3>
    <p>Moving forward, I am eager to expand my skills in web development. I plan to explore CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity to my projects. My ultimate goal is to build more complex web applications and websites that showcase my evolving skills and creativity.</p>
